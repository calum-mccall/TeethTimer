# Teeth Timer

Teeth timer is an Android app built in Kotlin and Java, with over 15,000 downloads to date.

Available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.calumcmccall.teethtimer).

## Motivation

This was a personal project undertaken with the goal of fully designing, developing and then releasing an app on the Google Play Store.

It was an opportunity to learn Kotlin, a language I had not previously used, as well as a chance to work through the entire software development cycle.

## The App

- The app uses a simple and visual 2 minute timer to make sure you're brushing for the correct time, every time.

- You can set morning and evening alarms to make sure that you remember to brush twice a day, every day.

- With 30 second reminders to ensure that no tooth gets left behind! Use the apps vibrations to remind you to brush the whole of your mouth and ensure you don't neglect any teeth!
